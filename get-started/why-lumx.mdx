_"Blockchain is a complex technology that requires a high level of technical expertise to implement and maintain. Tech challenges may hinder the widespread adoption of blockchain technology and discourage potential users and developers from engaging with it. Blockchain‚Äôs complexity can also lead to errors and inefficiencies in implementation."_, [Forbes.com](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/04/14/the-5-biggest-problems-with-blockchain-technology-everyone-must-know-about/?sh=1f9e150155d2)

On October 31st, 2008, almost 15 years ago, a mysterious individual (or a group of individuals) known as Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin Whitepaper and the blockchain technology has flourished ever since, but yet it still battles to reach mass adoption, and the main barrier in its way is nothing more than complexity.

## The regular blockchain journey

Let's take a look at a regular user's journey when first interacting with the technology while attempting to buy a token:

1. **Choosing a Wallet**: Users have to research different Web3 wallets, such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Coinbase Wallet or any of the other 30 possible options and verify if it supports all the major blockchains.

2. **Installing a Wallet**: When installing the desired wallet, users are faced with the concept of Seed Phrase and taught through not so user-friendly methods how to do their own custody.

These steps alone will take at least 10 minutes for a tech-savvy user. Imagine if you could solve it with just a few clicks while letting all kinds of users connect via e-mail, Google or any Web3 Wallet.

3. **Funding a Wallet**: To purchase their tokens users will need to fund their Web3 wallet with cryptocurrency. They can buy crypto from various exchanges, in which case they will need to set up a new account, go through their KYC, and then transfer the funds to their wallet.

4. **Connecting to a Website**: Users then have to go to the selected website where the token is available and look for the ‚ÄúConnect Wallet‚Äù button. This will prompt the user to select their Web3 wallet from the available options.

5. **Confirming the Transaction**: After clicking on ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù, the user's web3 wallet will prompt them to confirm the transaction. They'll have to read the details, such as the total cost and gas fees, and approve the transaction.

If your user hasn't given up while creating the account on the exchange, the extra taxes that showed up during the last step might make them rethink the purchase. Imagine if you could avoid all that hassle, paying with Credit Card or PIX (Only in Brazil), without leaving your website and no unexpected fees.

6. **Waiting for Confirmation**: Once users confirm the transaction, it will be broadcasted to the blockchain. They'll need to wait for the transaction to be mined and confirmed, which can take a few minutes depending on network congestion. Usually it goes through without problems.
   Wait, what? ‚ÄúUsually‚Äù? Yep. Their transaction might fail. It doesn‚Äôt happen frequently but it does happen sometimes, but let‚Äôs be optmistic shall we? Their transaction went through. They're now a proud owner of a token!

What if you could remove that risk altogether? Imagine you could see up a queue and never lose a transaction again.

Finally...Welcome to the blockchain ecosystem!

Sarcasm put aside, if you've read this far you can understand how this isn't even remotely close to an ideal user experience.

We have been through that. Lumx Protocol was created to solve these problems and to help developers create their own user-friendly Web3 platforms.

Let's build the Web3, easier, faster and best of all, together üöÄ
