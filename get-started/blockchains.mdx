We advise you to select among the already established and proven chains such as Linea, Optimism, or Polygon, but keep in mind that each one will have its pros and cons. While Ethereum is the home of all major projects, Polygon offers much lower gas fees and can save you thousands of dollars.

Please note: Due to the high gas costs of the Ethereum (ETH) network and its evolution to serve as a base chain for others, we have decided to remove support for the native ETH network from the customer's choice options.
