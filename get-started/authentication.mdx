You will receive a client access key after your company signs up to use our services.

If you want to become a partner or you haven't received your api key please contact us at hello@lumx.io or send a message on [our Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/lumxpartners/shared_invite/zt-1z920ovmb-V6~OlHpvQSQupe7kJLu5YA).

After receiving it, you can add the api key to your authorization header:

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <API_KEY>'
```

Endpoints that require admin authentication will be marked with the following notice throughout the documentation:
