There are two authentication methods.

## Admin authentication

This method is exclusive to our partners, companies and developers that have built their Web3 applications using our protocol. A client access key is received after your company signs up to use our services.

If you want to become a partner or you haven't received your api key please contact us at developer@lumxstudios.com or send a message on [our Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/lumxpartners/shared_invite/zt-1z920ovmb-V6~OlHpvQSQupe7kJLu5YA).

After receiving it, you can add the api key to your authorization header:

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <API_KEY>'
```

Endpoints that require admin authentication will be marked with the following notice throughout the documentation:

<Snippet file="admin-authentication.mdx" />

## User authentication

This method is open to all users. The user access token is received after a successful [sign in](/api-reference/sign-in).

After receiving it, you can add the user access key to the authorization header of that user's following requests:

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <TOKEN>'
```

Endpoints that require client authentication will be marked with the following notice throughout the documentation:

<Snippet file="user-authentication.mdx" />
