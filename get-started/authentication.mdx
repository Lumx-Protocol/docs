This method is exclusive to our partners, companies and developers that have built their Web3 applications using our protocol.

A client token is received after your company signs up to use our services.

If you want to become a partner or you haven't received your api key please contact us at developer@lumxstudios.com or send a message on [our Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/lumxpartners/shared_invite/zt-1z920ovmb-V6~OlHpvQSQupe7kJLu5YA).

After receiving it, you can add the token to your authorization header

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <TOKEN>'
```
