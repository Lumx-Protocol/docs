To start using our API, simply make a request to our [auth endpoint](/api-reference/auth), passing your organization's name. You will receive an api key to start making requests to our sandbox API right away.

When you're ready to start building in a production environment, please contact us at developer@lumxstudios.com or send a message on [our Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/lumxpartners/shared_invite/zt-1z920ovmb-V6~OlHpvQSQupe7kJLu5YA) for instructions on how to get a production API key.
