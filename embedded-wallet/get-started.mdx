    ```tsx App.tsx
    import {
        Wallet,
        WalletContextProvider,
    } from '@lumx-protocol/embedded-wallet';

    function App() {
    return (
    <WalletContextProvider
            clientId='YOUR_CLIENT_ID'
            onFinishAuth={() => {
                console.log('finish');
            }}>
            <Wallet />
    </WalletContextProvider>
    )}

    export default App
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title='Third step'>
        After the authentication, the user will be available on your localStorage under the key `wallet.user` and its token under `wallet.token`.

        ```
        wallet.user
        {
            id: string
            walletAddress: string
            name: string
            email: string
            phone: string
            cpf: string
            birthDate: string
        }
