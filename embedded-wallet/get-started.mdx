	<Step title='Second Step'>
		Once the widget provider is placed at the root of your application, you should be able to call the widget anywhere in your application.
    For more information on props and/or styling refer to our props section or the customization section on the docs. (Por links relevantes)
    ```tsx App.tsx
import {
	AuthClient,
	AuthContextProvider,
} from '@lumx-protocol/auth-client';

function App() {
      return (
        <AuthContextProviderProps
            clientId='Contact us to get your clientId'
            onFinishAuth={() => {
            console.log('finish');
        }}>
            <AuthClient />
        </AuthContextProvider>
    )}

export default App
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title='Third Step'>
        The user will be available on your localStorage under the key `widgets.user` and its token under `widgets.token` after the authentication has finished. It's up to you to implement auth and route guards.

        ```
        widgets.user
        {
            avatarUrl: string
            birthDate: string
            cpf:string
            email: string
            id: string
            name: string
            phone: string
            walletAddress: string
        }
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported Props

    ### Test mode
      > Pass `isProd={false}` to the AuthContextProviderProps component. Defaults to `true`.

    ### Authentication redirect
      > AuthContextProvider accepts a prop called ```onFinishAuth={() => {}}``` which will be called after the user is authenticated.
