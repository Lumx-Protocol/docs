Our checkout widget provides different payment methods for users to buy Web3 tokens, be it fungible tokens (cryptocurrencies) or non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Currently, the payment methods available include PIX (for Brazilian users) and Credit Card.

Check our prototype below.

## Usage

Copy the following code to the head of your website.

```JavaScript
<script src="https://widgets.lumxstudios.com"></script>

<script>
  widget.init({ clientId: <CLIENT_ID>, type: 'checkout' })
</script>
```

You can also call **widget.init** on any event on your application such as on-click or on-submit.

## Events

To seamlessly incorporate the widget into your app, it's essential to monitor the emitted events. These events come in four distinct types.

#### INIT_IFRAME

When it has been called and loaded successfully.

#### ORDER_INFO

When the transcation is successful. Contains the txHash, and can be used when you need to update your UI.

```JavaScript
{
  itemId: string
  amount: number
  price: number
  paymentMethod: string
  transactionHash: string
}
```

#### CLOSE_IFRAME

When the widget is closed and removed from the page.

#### END_AUTH

When the checkout process is finished.
