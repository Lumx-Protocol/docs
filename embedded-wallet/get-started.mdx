import {

} from '@lumx-protocol/auth-client';

function App() {
      return (
        <AuthContextProviderProps
            clientId='Contact us to get your clientId'
            onFinishAuth={() => {
            console.log('finish');

    	Some interesting props for you!

      Need to have a test mode first? 
      > Pass `isProd={false}` to the AuthContextProviderProps component.

      Do you want to redirect the user after authentication?
      > AuthContextProvider accepts a prop called ```onFinishAuth={() => {}}``` which will be called after the user is authenticated.
    </Step>
