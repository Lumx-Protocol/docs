    ```tsx App.tsx
    import {
        AuthClient,
        AuthContextProvider,
    } from '@lumx-protocol/auth-client';

    function App() {
    return (
    <AuthContextProviderProps
            clientId='YOUR_CLIENT_ID'
            onFinishAuth={() => {
                console.log('finish');
            }}>
            <AuthClient />
    </AuthContextProvider>
    )}

    export default App
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step title='Third step'>
        After the authentication, the user will be available on your localStorage under the key `wallet.user` and its token under `wallet.token`.

        ```
        widgets.user
        {
            id: string
            walletAddress: string
            name: string
            email: string
            phone: string
            cpf: string
            birthDate: string
        }
        ```
    </Step>

## Supported Props

    ### Test mode
      > Pass `isProd={false}` to the AuthContextProviderProps component. Defaults to `true`.

    ### Authentication redirect
      > AuthContextProvider accepts a prop called ```onFinishAuth={() => {}}``` which will be called after the user is authenticated.
