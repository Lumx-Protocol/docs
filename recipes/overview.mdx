Our recipes are designed to provide step-by-step instructions and code snippets to help you achieve specific tasks using our Protocol, as well as have a glimpse at what they can be used for.
For this, we separated them into an Admin Journey and User Journey.

While the Admin Journey simulates your company side of the process, the User Journey focuses on the end user actions.

Let's start with a simple [First Request](/recipes/first-request)

Alternatively, you can go straight to one of the specific, more complex, recipes. Check them all out below.
