In order to mint tokens, you will need to provide the wallet for which you want to mint the token. Using the [create wallet endpoint](/api-reference/wallets/create-a-wallet), you can create a wallet with a single API call:

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl --request POST \
  --url https://protocol-sandbox.lumx.io/v1/wallets \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY'
```

```javascript JavaScript
axios
  .post("https://protocol-sandbox.lumx.io/v1/wallets")
  .then((response) => {
    // Handle Success
    console.log(response);
});
```

</CodeGroup>

You will receive a status 201 with an object containing the id and the address for the newly created wallet. 

**Congratulations!** You can check your wallet on the [block explorer](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com), using the address you received.

That's it! You're now ready to start minting tokens using your contract and wallet.
